project status:


currently on hold due to the following reasons:

  -> Aiding Elements User Interface (there i use parts of es to control certain aspects of the program)
  -> learning C and later C++
  -> my first two FantasySciFi books, they are in the final stages of completion, at least the first one

as soon as possible, i will continue the thought process and work on es
